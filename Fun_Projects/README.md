# Fun_Projects

These are some of the small projects I did after learning new things. 
As I am still a beginner while writing this, they are mostly the very basic stuff but hey! I am still proud of them.

A quote I read a long time went something like this : "It's not a race against the World, it's about trying to be better than how you were a day before."
It resonated with me a lot over the years, even more so since I started to learn coding. It's not good to compare yourself to others, everyone has their own pace and their own road to walk. 
As long as you strive to be a better version of yourself each day, you are on the right path.
