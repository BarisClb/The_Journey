# Calculator_v1

Tried my hand at making a calculator after learning "eventListener"s. I did much simpler ones before, the kind that only does one kind of calculation so this one is a bit more advanced than those (since it stores the previous total and continues the new calculation from there).
I know it doesn't look very pretty, not only did I not use a CSS Framework like Bootstrap, I also didn't add a Clear/AllClear. To be completely honest, this was a really quick work and I just wanted to check if what I learned about the "eventListener"s stick with me or not.
I thought that "Learning new things is a lot more important than trying to do what I already know." so, instead of making it look good and adding a Clear button, I went back on the journey but I promise, I will get back to this project one day!

So, note to self :  1) Add a Clear/AllClear button.
                    2) Fix the simple Problems ( Example: You need to select an operation after the calculation total comes, else it will alter the total.)
                    3) Make it look better.
